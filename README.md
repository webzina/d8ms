Overview
===============
Drupal 8 multisite platform with composer.
This is a distro using [d8ms](https://github.com/dxvargas/d8ms) with the d8mspro
profile, which has some extra modules, theme and configuration.

:bell: This tool is under heavy construction, there are no releases at all.

Getting Started
===============
1. Clone this repo
1. Run `composer install`
1. Configure settings files
  * Create the file `drush/aliases.drushrc.local.php` based in `drush/aliases.drushrc.php`
  * Create the file `web/sites/sites.local.php` based in `web/sites/sites.php`
  * Create the file `web/sites/settings.allsites.local.php` based in `web/sites/settings.allsites.php`
1. Setup subsite configuration structure
  * Run `git clone https://github.com/dxvargas/d8ms-subsite subsite/default`
  * Make symlinks for the subsite directories
    * Run `cd config`
    * Run `ln -s ../subsite/default/config default`
1. Install Drupal
    * Run `cd ../web` and `drush @default site-install -vy --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin --config-dir=../config/default/sync`
    * Verify that sites are working: `drush @default status`

Creating a new Subite (e.g. `foo`) with d8mspro profile
===============

1. Configure settings files
  * Run `cp -r web/sites/default web/sites/foo && rm -rf web/sites/foo/files/*` and make sure web/sites/foo/settings.php is writable
  * Add entry for `foo` in `drush/aliases.drushrc.local.php`
  * Add entry for `foo` in `web/sites/sites.local.php`
  * Probably you'll need to add a new entry to "trusted_host_patterns" in `settings.allsites.local.php`
1. Setup subsite configuration structure
  * Run `mkdir subsite/foo subsite/foo/config`
  * Make symlinks for the subsite directories
    * Run `cd config`
    * Run `ln -s ../subsite/foo/config foo`
1. Install Drupal
    * Run `cd ../web` and `drush @foo site-install d8mspro -vy --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin`
    * Verify that sites are working: `drush @foo status`
1. Configure subsite/foo to have it's own repository
1. Usually you will also want to have custom themes and modules, you can store
them in `subsite/foo` and add symlinks in usual directories

Notes
===============

1. If subsite configuration structure is only for sync files, the repository
can be cloned directly there. If so, you it is not needed to use symlinks;
1. Many of the steps for first install and creating a new subsite will be
automated with a script;
